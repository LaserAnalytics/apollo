The install files and instructions to install the Starlight Xpress SXVF-H9
camera are in `SXVF-H9_install.zip`.

Apollo requires the [Laser Analytics TIFF writing library][latwuc] to function.
A compiled .dll is included in the `lib` folder, but this may not work if your
system is not 32-bit windows. To recompile the latwuc.dll file, please the the
[latwuc][latwuc] github page.
